			<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> began my career at SIUE with my declared major in Art Education. In my first semester, I took a required introductory level education course where I learned about something that would become an integral part of my own learning process. John Dewey's 1897 Philosophy of Education, or “My Pedagogic Creed” outlines the ideas of what school is, should be, and will become; each statement of these articles beginning with “I believe” and defines the importance of educational process. Throughout this course, and the following classrooms that I would sit in as a student, observer, and—at times—educator, I began to realize that I was forming my own Creed. When I made the decision to pursue Art History for the remainder of my undergraduate career, I began to learn even more about the ways the visual world has shaped the global narrative; ways art exists as a fundamental part of the human condition. Studying Abroad changed everything for me, and solidified the feeling that I was finally on the right path to doing more for the world than I had ever imagined.</p>

			<p>I believe that the force that separates human from animal is a drive for symbolic meaning.</p>

			<p>I believe that at the earliest points of civilization, humankind began to create to do more than just survive. Cave paintings, decorated ceramics, the written word—all created to document and preserve pieces of culture for years to come.</p>

			<p>I believe that the stories that have been passed down from generation to generation become links in a chain that ground us to the world, but connect us to something far greater than ourselves.</p>

			<p>I believe that experience is the key to understanding, and that the door to making a difference is through an open mind.</p>

			<p>I believe that dedication of self to become focus driven and passionate for execution and integrity is what sets one apart from the crowd.</p>

			<p>I believe that I am a part of a global future and positive change.</p>
