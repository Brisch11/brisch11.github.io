				<h5>Contemporary Experience and Memory: Observing that Which No Longer Stands</h5>
				<p><i>History of Modern Architecture, Fall 2016</i></p>

				<p>The world around us is shaped by personal experience. How we see buildings, exist within certain spaces, and live among others can tell us so much about how life on this Earth is perceived. Canadian artist Janet Cardiff focuses on elements of personal experience and memory to exhibit how nature and architecture is observed and used in everyday life. In 2000, for an exhibition at the St.Louis Art Museum titled Wonderland, Cardiff created a fifteen minute audio guided walking tour of the grounds of Forest Park that once held the 1904 World’s Fair accompanied by pictures of the fairground architecture while it still stood. Wonderland focused on installations and how viewers of art moved around and experienced its placement. Cardiff’s walk, Taking Pictures, focused on a personal connection to space both in the moment, and in focus of a time that only exists through memory. Through exploration of these concepts, participants come closer to finding their own meaning and understanding of their place in the world. The landscape of Forest Park has changed since this walk was first recorded, so it is impossible to recreate the steps that Cardiff had taken; creating an even deeper meaning to the performance and one’s own experience of the historic site.</p>

				<h5>Diego Velazquez and the Spanish Inquisition</h5>
				<p><i>Baroque Art, Spring 2017</i></p>

				<p>Diego Velázquez is considered to be one of the greatest Spanish painters of the 17th century. Although known for his portraiture and genre painting, Velazquez also created a small number of religious works that reflect the influences of the Spanish Inquisition and his role as a converso, or “New Christian”, in Spanish-Catholic society. His close relations with the Spanish court and the imagery of his religious paintings reflect a personal determination to be accepted into both Spanish and Christian society. This paper examines Velázquez’s lineage and connections to Jewish heritage, which fueled a motivation to attach his name and association with affiliates of the Church and offices of the Inquisition. By looking at selected works of Velázquez and the patrons which commissioned them, evidence arises that the artist sought immunity from the Inquisition through a reputation of Christian piety.</p>

				<h5>Zaha Hadid and Modern Islamic Architecture</h5>
				<p><i>Islamic Art and Architecture, Spring 2017</i></p>

				<p>Architect Zaha Hadid’s unique architectural language awarded her many global triumphs throughout her lifetime, such as the esteemed Stirling prize and becoming one of two women inducted into the Oscars of Architecture. She is also the first woman architect to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal as well as the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Her style is mostly attributed to Deconstructivism, a stylistic movement from the early 20th century that speaks to a complex relationship between viewer, space, and the individual experience that happens therein. Hadid’s use of geometric patterning, abstract curvatures, and dynamic uses of light and sound create visually stimulating structures that align with ideals of other architects within the movement such as Rem Koolhaas, Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, and Mies van der Rohe. However, when considering Hadid’s upbringing in Baghdad, Iraq, and her personal experiences with Islamic culture in her early life, there becomes evident characteristics of traditional Islamic architecture in both formal quality and ideologic space. This paper reflects on her designs for the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, and the Strasbourg Mosque in Strasbourg, France (unbuilt) as examples of Hadid’s interest in combining Deconstructivist ideas of purity of form with the intricate and symbolic presence within Islamic architecture.</p>

				<h5>Standing Vishnu and the Enthroned Virgin with Child</h5>
				<p><i>Art of India, Summer 2017</i></p>

				<p>This paper compares the formal qualities of western and non-western religious art through the examination of the Standing Vishnu, a 11th century Chola Dynasty bronze and Enthroned Virgin with Child, a wooden reliquary from 12th century France. When comparing the Western representation of the Madonna to the Hindu statue of Vishnu, the elements of worship become quite similar: both would have been used in ritual practice and represent wisdom, creation, and divine duality. Both of these works express the beliefs of two very different ideas of how the world was created and how spirituality guides the lives of its followers.</p>

				<h5>The Modern Nude</h5>
				<p><i>History of Modern Art, Fall 2017</i></p>

				<p>Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, societal shifts occurred throughout the world that had major influences on the fine and visual arts. Although the classical forms of academic tradition remained the favored, many artists attempted to take those ideas and refine them in a variety of ways to reflect a new concept of “modernity”. Artists embraced and borrowed from motifs and traditions of non-western cultures to respond to the urban landscape and industrialization of European society. Though timeless in tradition, the use of the nude figure in art changed drastically in European art through modernist notions of abstraction. Interests in psychology, philosophy, and the human condition also had significant impacts on the representation and interpretation of the nude form in modern painting. Looking at the styles of various Modern painters, this paper reflects on the representation of the nude figure in Modern painting in comparison to the ideals that informed the styles of antiquity.</p>

				<h5>Pictures of Pruitt-Igoe</h5>
				<p><i>History of Photography, Fall 2017</i></p>

				<p>On March 16, 1972 the first building of thirty-three within the Pruitt-Igoe housing district in St.Louis, Missouri was razed on live television. What was once meant to be considered the height of modernism and the way of future urban life fell to disrepair, decay, and death. By 1976 the landscape was completely flattened; all that would remain were photographers. Video footage and photographs of not only the architecture of Pruitt-Igoe, but its depiction in the media during its construction and of the lives of the residents help provide a gaze into what some scholars have called the “death” of Modernism. When seen as a documentary footage, the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe Apartments brings to light a new set of questions of how we perceive ruins when all that we have is a photograph.</p>

				<h5>Art Nouveau and Early Cinema:  Metropolis in terms of the movement’s Influences</h5>
				<p><i>Art Nouveau, Fall 2017</i></p>

				<p>The beginning of Modern art, as referred to by scholars today, looks heavily at the context of industrialization and technological advancement on the world to create paradigms for understanding the art of the time. Historians have looked at music, literature, theatre, and academic traditions of artists and writers; however one genre of the Modern arts that is often overlooked is film. As the film industry has exploded in the years since Art Nouveau first saw its day, it is impossible to compare every genre and individual film to the concepts and imagery of Art Nouveau. However, a few critically regarded “classics” from cinema’s inception contain evidence of Art Nouveau’s continued influence on the fine, decorative, and film arts. I seek to further examine the research of Lucy Fischer’s Cinema by Design  by looking at the film styles, set designs, and subject matter from Fritz Lang’s 1927 production titled Metropolis as an example of Art Nouveau’s influence on early cinematic productions.</p>

				<h5>The Bible of Borso d’Este</h5>
				<p><i>Italian Renaissance Art, Fall 2017</i></p>

				<p>The province of Ferrara in 15th century Italy was ruled by the Este court, a family who was able to create for themselves an association of power and splendor through their artistic patronage. Borso d’Este, an illegitimate son of Niccolò III d’Este, assumed the role of Marchese after the passing of his half-brother Leonello in 1450. Known for his interest in reputation as a Magnifico, Borso commissioned a grand, two-volume Bible with over a thousand individual miniature paintings that associated his rule with Christian piety and civic achievement within Ferrara. Looking at iconography within the pages of Borso’s Bible, his personal badges and symbols of House of Este, it can be seen that this Bible not only served to boost the splendor of House d’Este, but to legitimize Borso’s personal aspirations of being named Duke of Ferrara by the Pope and establishing a legacy for the title within the family.</p>
