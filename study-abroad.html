			<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> studied abroad with the American Institute for Foreign Study (AIFS) during the Summer 2016 term on the European Art and Architecture program, and I honestly feel that I cannot put into words just how momentous of an experience it was for me. Prior to my trip I had never traveled alone; I had never set foot on non-US soil, nor had I ever been in an airplane. To top it all off, I had never been away from my home state for more than a couple of weeks at a time. Suffice to say, this adventure was going to offer a unique set of challenges that I would have to rise up to as an individual. I’ll admit, the nerves got the better of me more often than I’d like to say, but with the rallying support of friends, family, and the International Relations network on my home campus, I was fully committed to strengthening myself as an individual. As someone who has only ever lived in one place her entire life, there has always been a part of me that, at its core, knew that the world is far too big to stay in one place.</p>

			<p>After returning home from a whirlwind trip that took me through London, Amsterdam, Paris, Bruges, Lucerne, Venice, Florence, and Rome in just four short weeks, I realized that the exhilaration that comes from learning about new cultures through immersion and an open mind  is a fundamental process to becoming an advocate for positive change. I did not want to keep my experience as a memento of the past, but to use it as a tool to help give others the opportunity to see that education through experience is just as important as anything that can be learned in a classroom. I entered the academic year of 2017-2018 not only as a senior anticipating my final research projects in Art History, but as an Ambassador for AIFS. This position has granted me the ability to turn my experience into an opportunity, and has assisted in providing me excellent resources to prepare me for my professional career.</p>

			<p>I was speaking to a friend who was set to fly to China with the Peace Corps just hours before I was scheduled to depart for London. He said, “don’t worry. Just take it all in. You’re a Citizen of the World now.”
			I intend to continue to be this person going forward, and will never stop learning from the world.</p>
